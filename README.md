**This was a little program I made for fun. I thought it was pretty cute**

## Neko Atsume Background

Neko Atsume is a popular Japanese mobile game. The game's name is translated as "cat collecting" or "gathering cats." The goal of the game is to collect as many cats as possible and add them to a player's virtual catbook.

## Program Information

This code is for a web page that emulates a toy simulator that is "Neko Atsume" themed. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

This program enables users to interact with four different cats. Users can specify the number of times they want their selected cat to catch the 'Mister Dragonfly' toy, and the cat will respond accordingly. In addition, the website also includes an information banner and a music option for those who are interested.

**A basic rundown of how it was coded, and how it works**

> The program receives user input for the number of times they want the cat to catch the toy.

> Using a loop, the program repeats the action of the cat catching the toy until the specified number of catches is reached.

> The program updates a score or counter variable to keep track of the number of catches.

> The program displays an information banner and provides a music option using GUI elements and event handlers.

> When the program is closed or exited, any necessary cleanup operations are performed, such as closing open files or releasing system resources.

I had planned to change the input label from 'Enter cat playtime' to match the name of the cat that is currently on the screen. For instance, if someone selects the first cat, the label would say 'Enter Bandit's playtime,' and if the third cat is chosen, it would change to 'Enter Sunny's playtime.' Additionally, I wanted to include sound effects to the buttons. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any suitable ones online, so if I really wanted to perfect this I'd have to get the sound effects myself. In the future, I hope to implement these features and also improve the design by incorporating easter eggs and other elements.

All the music and images used are included in this repository!
